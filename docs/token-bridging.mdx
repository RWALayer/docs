title: Token Bridging
description: 'Bridging tokens to RWALayer involves transferring assets to the designated RWALayer Bridge address on
Layer 1 (L1). Once the deposit transaction is confirmed on L1, your balance will be updated on Layer 2 (L2) after the
RWALayer Sequencer processes the transaction.'
