title: "Transaction States"
---

In RWALayer, transactions progress through distinct states, each pivotal for transaction execution and blockchain
integrity. The following steps outline the journey from sending a transaction to its finalization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Transaction">
    **Action**: A user initiates a transaction on the RWALayer network.

    **State**: Pending Confirmation

    Upon initiation, transactions enter a pending state, awaiting confirmation. This preliminary phase denotes the
    transaction's initiation.

    **How to Track**: Access pending transactions through RWALayer's monitoring tools or use the JSON-RPC method
    `eth_getBlockByNumber` with the block number parameter set to `pending`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sequencer Validation">
    **Action**: The transaction is processed by the Sequencer.

    **State**: Sequencer Validation

    Transactions successfully validated by the Sequencer are marked as "sequencer confirmed" or "unsafe." While
    included in a block, these transactions remain subject to further validation before blockchain confirmation.

    **How to Track**: Monitor the latest "sequencer validated" block using `eth_getBlockByNumber` with the block number
    parameter set to `safe`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blockchain Confirmation">
    **Action**: The transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.

    **State**: Blockchain Confirmation

    Upon confirmation on the blockchain, transactions achieve "blockchain confirmed" status, signifying inclusion in a
    block pending publication to the broader network. Despite progress, uncertainties persist due to re-org.

    **How to Track**: Query the latest "blockchain confirmed" block using `eth_getBlockByNumber` with the parameter
    set to `safe`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalization">
    **Action**: The transaction is finalized and embedded in the blockchain.

    **State**: Finalization

    Finalized transactions are securely embedded within the blockchain, representing completed actions within
    RWALayer's immutable ledger. With all uncertainties dispelled, finalized transactions ensure data integrity
    and transactional certainty.

    **How to Track**: Stay updated on finalized transactions through RWALayer's interface or `eth_getBlockByNumber`
    with the parameter set to `finalized`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Understanding these transaction states is fundamental for effective transaction management within RWALayer.
