title: "Gasless Transactions"
---
In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, we are proud to introduce our gasless transactions. Designed
with user convenience and efficiency in mind, this innovative solution eliminates the need for gas fees, making
blockchain interactions more accessible and seamless for everyone.

## What is a Gasless Chain?

<Info>
    A gasless chain is a type of blockchain network where transactions do not require the typical gas fees that are
    common in most blockchain systems. Gas fees are small amounts of cryptocurrency paid by users to compensate for the
    computational power required to process and validate transactions. While these fees help secure the network, they
    can also be a barrier to entry for new users and can fluctuate, leading to unpredictable costs.

<Callout type="success" title="Optimized Consensus Mechanism">
    Our blockchain uses a highly efficient consensus algorithm that requires minimal computational resources, reducing
    the need for compensatory fees.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Layered Architecture">
    Similar to the principles outlined in the RWA Layer documentation, our chain employs a multi-layered architecture.
    This architecture separates transaction processing from data storage and validation, streamlining operations and
    reducing costs.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Incentive Models">
    Instead of gas fees, we utilize alternative incentive models to reward validators and network participants. These
    models ensure network security and participation without directly charging users.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Sponsorship Programs">
    Projects and dApps on our platform can sponsor transactions for their users, covering any associated costs and
    providing a truly gasless experience.
