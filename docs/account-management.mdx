To build a product that indexes ETH balances on RWALayer, it’s essential to understand RWALayer’s unique account model.
Unlike other EVM chains, RWALayer represents ETH balances in terms of **shares**. Each account has a certain number of
shares, which are multiplied by a **global share** price to determine its ETH balance. This method allows account
balances to automatically rebase as new yield is reported and the global share price increases.

For accurate indexing, save individual account shares and the global share price instead of the direct account
balances. At read time, an account’s balance can be derived by multiplying its shares with the global share price.

    This document details how to accurately index every account’s ETH balance on RWALayer using this approach.

# Yield Modes Explained

RWALayer accounts offer three different yield modes, providing users and developers with control over rebasing when new
yield is reported:

<StepGroup>
  <Step title="AUTOMATIC">
    ETH balance automatically rebases (increasing only).
  </Step>
  <Step title="VOID">
    ETH balance never changes in response to yield; no yield is earned.
  </Step>
  <Step title="CLAIMABLE">
    Yield accumulates separately and can be claimed to any recipient address.
  </Step>
</StepGroup>

### Default Settings

By default, all RWALayer accounts are set to `AUTOMATIC` yield mode, meaning their ETH balances will rebase
automatically. However, when a smart contract is deployed to an address, the account switches to `VOID` mode. This
means that smart contract accounts default to `VOID` mode, while EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) default to
`AUTOMATIC` mode.

<Info type="warning">
    It’s possible (though uncommon) for ETH to be held by an account before a smart contract is deployed to it.
</Info>

Both smart contracts and EOAs can change their yield modes (e.g., a smart contract opting in or an EOA opting out).

## RWALayer’s Account Model

RWALayer employs a modified version of `op-geth` (`RWALayer-geth`) to represent balances in shares, enabling all
accounts to update as yield is reported. Specifically, `RWALayer-geth` modifies the `StateAccount` struct to achieve
this:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="op-geth (Upstream)">
    ```git
    type StateAccount struct {
      Nonce    uint64
      Root     common.Hash
      CodeHash []byte
      Balance  *big.Int
    }
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="RWALayer-geth">
    ```git
    type StateAccount struct {
      Nonce     uint64
      Root      common.Hash
      CodeHash  []byte
      Flags     uint8
      Fixed     *big.Int
      Shares    *big.Int
      Remainder *big.Int
    }
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The desired yield mode is stored in the `Flags` field, while the `Fixed`, `Shares`, and `Remainder` fields store the
data required to calculate account balances in each yield mode:

<Expandable title="AUTOMATIC Mode">
  In `AUTOMATIC` mode, balances increase automatically as yield is reported to the L2:

  ```
  balance = account.shares * sharePrice + account.remainder
  claimable = 0
  ```

  `account.remainder` is a small value to ensure wei-level precision.

  <Note>
    `account.remainder` will always be less than `sharePrice`, otherwise `account.shares` would be higher.
  </Note>
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="VOID Mode">
  In `VOID` mode, the balance remains static and no yield can be claimed:

  ```
  balance = account.fixed
  claimable = 0
  ```
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="CLAIMABLE Mode">
  In `CLAIMABLE` mode, yield accumulates separately and can be claimed by the account’s governor to any recipient
  address:

  ```
  balance = account.fixed
  claimable = account.shares * sharePrice + account.remainder - account.fixed
  ```

  The `claimable` value refers to the yield that can be claimed.

  <Alert type="warning">
    No `Transfer` event is emitted when yield is claimed, which can sometimes lead to confusion.
  </Alert>
</Expandable>

## Global Share Price

The global share price that determines how much ETH each share is worth is stored in the SharesBase predeploy at.
This contract tracks the share price, the total number of shares, and the total amount of ETH yet to be
reflected in the share price. You can read the current ETH share price by calling the `price()` function on this
contract.

## Indexing Account Shares

For accurate results, index account shares instead of account balances directly. This works similarly to indexing
balances on ETH mainnet: identify which accounts were touched in transactions within a given block and re-fetch their
balances on that block.

RWALayer nodes expose a new RPC method, `eth_getBalanceValues`, to support indexing the `flags`, `shares`, `remainder`,
and `fixed` fields for accounts.

### `eth_getBalanceValues` Request

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_getBalanceValues",
  "params": ["<address>", "latest"],
  "id": 1
}
```

### `eth_getBalanceValues` Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "fixed": "0x0",
    "flags": "0x1",
    "remainder": "0x0",
    "shares": "0x0"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

## Edge Cases

On Ethereum mainnet, `selfdestruct` allows ETH to be sent to a beneficiary address without triggering any code at that
address. As a result, the beneficiary account’s balance changes without there being any `call` made. Indexers must
handle this edge case to ensure perfect accounting.

RWALayer introduces a similar edge case that indexers should be aware of. Accounts set to `CLAIMABLE` yield mode can
claim accumulated yield to an arbitrary beneficiary address. This claim operation works the same as `selfdestruct` in
that it can increase an arbitrary account’s balance without a `call`.

<Alert type="info">
While this edge case is exceptionally rare and not particularly important to handle, we include it here for completeness.
