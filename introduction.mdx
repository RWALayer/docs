title: Introduction
description: 'RWALayer is a blockchain network that enables dual yield. The goal of RWALayer is combining the yield from decentralized & real world markets. 
<br />
RWALayer activates and auto rebases yield opportunities from on-chain native staking, precious metals, real estate, corporate & government bonds, carbon credits and private credit markets. 
<br />
RWALayer is built with a single mission: automated, diversified, verifiable RWA yield made accessible to on-chain users. In order to achieve this mission, RWALayer builds Layer-2 for RWA economy, secured by restaking. In addition, RWALayer creates supplementary applications and software development kits for developers to build native products. 
<br />
All bridged assets are stored on licensed web3 custodians and subject to available auto rebasing dual yield opportunities.
