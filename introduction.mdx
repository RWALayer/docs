title: Introduction
description: 'RWALayer is a blockchain network that enables dual yield. The goal of RWALayer is combining the yield from decentralized & real world markets. 
<br /><br />
RWALayer activates and auto rebases yield opportunities from on-chain native staking, precious metals, real estate, corporate & government bonds, carbon credits and private credit markets. 
<br /><br />
RWALayer is built with a single mission: automated, diversified, verifiable RWA yield made accessible to on-chain users. In order to achieve this mission, RWALayer builds Layer-2 for RWA economy, secured by restaking. In addition, RWALayer creates supplementary applications and software development kits for developers to build native products. 
<br /><br />
All bridged assets are stored on licensed web3 custodians and subject to available auto rebasing dual yield opportunities.

## Mission & Purpose


The main reason for creating a Layer-2 network for dual yield is due to the opportunity costs associated with idle token holdings. It is evident that the majority of crypto natives do not exercise their right to access on-chain yield opportunities. 

RWALayer simplifies the access to various opportunities: ETH native staking via Lido, T-Bill yield via MakerDAO, USDC via Spool, BNB & CAKE native staking via Ceffu, bonds via Ondo, precious metals via Tether Gold. These opportunities are accessible by bridging assets to RWALayer. The yield from these opportunities is auto rebasing: this means that users do not need to complete additional steps after bridging in order to activate the on-chain yield opportunities.

On-chain users experience further opportunity cost by foregoing RWA opportunities due to the constraints of capital movement between web3 and real world finance. RWALayer provides access to regulated RWA products (sourcing yield from global real estate, commodities, private credit, etc.) that are auto rebasing yield directly to the user.


## RWA Market Drivers

2024 is the first time in history where building a blockchain for decentralized & traditional yield is possible. 

1. Regulatory Clarity

The regulatory and compliance procedures for Real World Asset (RWA) protocols have been approved and used by various RWA protocols.

2. Technological Circumstances

With the ETH Shanghai Upgrade and wider trust in auto rebasing, there is an untapped avenue to lockup idle assets for yield generation.

Security Infrastructure

Major digital asset custodians (including our partner Ceffu) are sufficiently advanced in their offerings to support a blockchain use case for yield.

Awareness

The general public is increasingly aware of the DeFi asset class  to support a $10bn addressable market.

Onchain Capital Surge

Over $100bn in stablecoins from retail and institutional holders sit idle and incur opportunity cost without T-Bill exposure, while losing value to inflation. Blockchain with auto rebasing addresses it.
